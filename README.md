# 🎧 Music Recommendation System using Lyrics 

In this beginner-friendly project, we built a **Music Recommendation System** using **Python** and **Streamlit** from scratch! The app recommends songs based on **lyrics similarity** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍  
- Streamlit 🌐  
- pandas 🐼  
- scikit-learn  
- NLP: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity

---

## 💡 Features

- Recommend similar songs based on input lyrics  
- User-friendly Streamlit UI  
- Fast and interactive app

---

## 📁 Dataset

Used a lyrics-based dataset to train the recommendation engine. You can use your own dataset or a public one from Kaggle.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Lyrics are vectorized using **TF-IDF**
2. Similarity is calculated using **cosine similarity**
3. Top similar songs are returned as recommendations

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
